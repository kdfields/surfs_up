# Surfs Up!

## Project Overview
The purpose of the analysis was to build on our existing knowledge of SQL database structures and querying methods by implementing new tools such as SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask to analyze weather data for a possible investment opportunity.  The investment opportunity is a surf and shake shop serving surfboards and icecream to locals and tourists on the beautiful island of Awahoo.  A prominent investor, W. Avy, is interested in the opportunity but wants to make sure the weather is warm and dry enough to sustain a business highly dependent on the weather.

## Resources
+ Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
+ Software: SQLite, Visual Studio Code

## Results
3 Key Differences in the weather in June in December in Awahoo:
+ The average temperature in Awahoo is about 4 degrees warmer in June than December.
+ While the minimum temperature in June was about 8 degrees warmer than December, the maximum temperature for June was only 2 degrees warmer than December.
+ The standard deviation for temperatures in December is higher than June, meaning there's a wider range of temperature variance in December than June.
